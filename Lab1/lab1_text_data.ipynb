When you are done you will save your (completed) notebook in Kaggle, Colab, or a GitHub gist, and then submit the link to it in Canvas. \n",

    "Note that this notebook does not look like most Jupyter notebooks you will see. That's because you will typically load all of the Python modules/libraries that you need at the beginning in the very first code cell. However, in order for us to see which library we're using where, we'll load them immediately before we need them. For a brief intro on what Jupyter notebooks are and how they work, check out [this short tutorial by Jeremy Howard](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/jupyter-notebook-101).\n",

To do so we'll need to load the dataset into a `pandas` `DataFrame`. If the data is stored locally then we would use `pd.read_csv(\"path/to/file/file.csv\")` to open it. In this case, the data is online at GitHub. Fortunately, the `pandas` module also knows how to open a file from a URL without any additional parameters. So, we can still use the same method but with the URL instead of the local path, as seen below. \n",

We will not dig much into actual EDA in this notebook, but it's important to note that this is a critical step in any data analysis or modeling project. If we were to complete a full EDA though, there are many tools that can help out, such as the [ydata-profiling project](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) Python module. Perhaps not surprising, AI tools and LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) can even perform a simple EDA on a dataset. \n",

Since we want to keep things simple here, and focus only on the lemmatization step, we'll assume every word is the same part of speech.

As stated above, we see that the same words are present in the data but not necessarily in the same order. Disregarding word order when vectorizing text data is sometimes (informally) referred to as a \"[__bag-of-words__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)\" approach. Often times, \"__bag-of-words__\" suggests that just the counts (i.e. __term frequency__) is used, rather than what we are using here, __term-frequency inverse-document-frequency__. Nonetheless, the underlying idea that words frequency is accounted for, but word order is neglected, is an important observation to make here."

    "Okay, the model performance on the test data is not nearly as good as the performance on the training dataset. That's expected to some degree. \n",

    "We may be able to improve it slightly by finding the optimal value of one of the random forest hyperparameters, e.g. `n_estimators`. However, one of the strengths of random forest is not it does a good job of overfitting. Knowing that, how do you think smaller values of `n_estimators` will affect accuracy on the test data? How do you think larger values will affect it? Try a few different values of `n_estimators`, both larger and smaller than the default of `n_estimators=100`, to see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we go ahead and try many different hyperparameter values (for n_estimators) to see what the best value is. As can be seen, there is not an immediately obvious choice for the best value of the n_estimators hyperparameter, which is exactly why random forest is such a nice to model to use at the beginning. Admittedly, an RF model might not perform as well as some other machine learning models, but it is reliable and does a decent job at balancing the Bias-Variance Tradeoff right away without a lot of tuning.
